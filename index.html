							<h1>Hi I'm Michael</h1>
							<p class="major"> I am recent graduate from Flatiron School's Data Science Bootcamp, currently honing my machine learning skills through individual and
								group projects using SQL, Python, data visualization, and more. I have a Bachelor's in Philosophy with a minor in Mathematics, and I
								am motivated to use data to tell a story and drive smart business decisions. I have a creative spirit, exceptional teamwork skills, and
								outside interests in animals and screenwriting</p>

							<h2>Screenplay Genre Classifier</h2>
							<p>My passion for data science is as strong as my passion for writing. My film aspirations began when I was a child but I only took action on those feelings during college where I wrote and pitched screenplays for a start-up production company. Now I have intersected my desire for writing with my desire for machine learning by developing a multi-label classification model that uses natural language processing to label the genres of a given screenplay.</p>

							<h2>NBA Draft Classifier</h2>
							<p>Throughout my youth I played many sports such as basketball, baseball, lacrosse, soccer, and volleyball. But out of all of them, basketball was always my favorite. Like data science, basketball tells a story and the stats that players record through their career can predict whether they have what it takes to be the best or sit on the bench. In this project, I anaylzed college players' basketball stats and classified each player into what round they would be drafted into, in the NBA draft.</p>

							<h2>Crypto Twitter Topic Modeling and Price Prediction</h2>
							<p> The last two years of our lives were objectively phenomenal. The pandemic, the increased political partisanship, foregin wars, and more. But what peeked my interest the most was the increasing volatility and volume in the crypto market. After months of research, I hypothesized Twitter as the contributor to attracting investors to this new currency technology. In this project, I scrapped over a million tweets from the last two years from the top 100 users in crypto twitter in order to see if their opinons were the main market movers of the price of Ethereum.</p>

							<h2>Work Experience</h2>
							<p>Truthfully speaking, I have little to no work experience in the data science field. Since the summer of 2021, have I been teaching myself Python then to participate in a data science bootcamp to learn how to implement different machine learning techinques. Although what I lack of in-house corporate technical expierence, is made up by my team-building skills, desire to learn the ins and outs of different industries, and my motivation to enter the unknowns of life. </p>
